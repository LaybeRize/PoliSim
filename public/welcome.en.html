    <h1>PoliSim</h1>
    <p>
        PoliSim is a tool to visualise and store the documents and relationships of a political simulation.<br>
        Direct communication in writing and language between individual users is not yet a goal or part of the project.
    </p>
    <h1>What can I do?</h1>
    <p>
        PoliSim allows people to create and manage organisations and titles. Users can create notes or documents
        or write articles. Discussions can be held and votes can be cast.<br>
        How exactly the individual areas work is explained below.
    </p>
    <h2>Titles</h2>
    <p>
        Titles are managed by the administration. They have no further role, but are mainly there to give people a flair
        or to document their position within the simulation.
    </p>
    <h2>Organisations</h2>
    <p>
        Organisations are by far the most complex part of the simulation. They are the instrument through which the players carry out their actions.
        While the press and notes are mainly intended for expressing opinions, decisions are discussed in the organisations,
        voted on and later turned into official documents. The administrators can create discussions or
        prepare votes and then attach them to voting documents to enable users to participate.<br>
        Discussions and votes are also the only area in which the readership can be restricted. This means that in private and secret
        organisations, documents can only be made visible to certain people. Of course, it is important to remember that every participant is automatically
        authorised to view the document.
    </p>
    <h2>Newspapers and the Press</h2>
    <p>
        The newspapers in the simulation is managed by the administration, specifically by a subgroup of administrators who are
        also allowed to reject articles and publish issues of newspapers. These users have no special
        privileges outside of working with the press.
        When writing an article, it must therefore always be borne in mind that someone can reject it again, which
        is not possible for the next point - notes.
    </p>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>
        The notes are a kind of black board on which every user can post their theses and statements. A note can refer to 0 or X other
        notes, which are also linked below the note. This allows users to scroll through the references and find out what
        the author is actually referring to.
